# Boardgame Leaderboard (for friendly, in-house use)
Currently WIP.

Developing a web app to keep track of my partner Jenny's and my boardgame statistics.

Plans to create a slackbot so we can post and view directly from our personal workspaces.

Additional plans to incorporate more friends until we have a community leaderboard.

Watch this space!
